# NASCIS
Open source version of NASCIS app in XCode 6 and Swift (for iOS8 and up)

Rejected by Apple [for this reason](http://blog.digitalneurosurgeon.com/?p=2693):
>Regarding point 22.9: “Apps that calculate medicinal dosages must be submitted by the manufacturer of those medications or recognized institutions such as hospitals, insurance companies, and universities”

Now available as open source version for those interested in Swift development or locally compiling the app.
